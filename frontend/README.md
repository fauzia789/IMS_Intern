Backend (config.js, app.js)
MongoDB Connection: The app is connected to MongoDB using Mongoose, and applicant data is stored in a collection called "Applicants."
CRUD Operations:
Get: Fetch applicants based on optional filters like name and status.
Post: Add new applicants to the database.
Delete: Remove an applicant by ID.
Put: Update an applicant's application date or status.
Frontend (Dashboard.js, RolePage.js)
Dashboard: A simple interface displaying roles (e.g., Web Application Trainee, UI/UX Designer Trainee, Sales/Marketing Trainee). Clicking on a role will take the user to the corresponding page for viewing and managing applicants.
RolePage: Displays applicants for a specific role, with options to:
Add: Show a modal for adding new applicants.
Remove: Delete applicants from the database.
Update: Update applicants' application status and date.
Recommendations:
Error Handling: Ensure that all error messages are displayed clearly in both the frontend and backend. It might be helpful to create custom error messages for specific actions.
Security: Consider using environment variables for sensitive data like MongoDB credentials instead of hardcoding them in the config.js file.
